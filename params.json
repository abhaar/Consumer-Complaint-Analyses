This helps banks prioritize customers’ problems on specific constraints such as response time, etc.\r\nWith our new metric system, banks can relatively prioritize the complaints to resolve!\r\n\r\nDEMO of our Work\r\nCompilation Instructions\r\n\r\nClassification [Note: Ensure Hadoop 2.5.1, Maven are installed.
