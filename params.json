{"name":"Consumer Complaint Analyses","tagline":"Big Data Analytics - EECS E6893 Final Project (Fall 2014)","body":"## Abstract\r\nRetail banking is heavily dependent on customer satisfaction and the ability with which a financial institution can address customer complaints and issues. We aim to provide an insight into the various facets of customer complaints in an attempt to help highlight the most significant issues plaguing the industry and move on to providing a quantitative metric that will help financial institutions determine the severity of a complaint. To this end, we provide a software package that is tailor made to the publicly available dataset from the Consumer Finance Bureau which will provide various details including but not limited to the most troublesome products, the problems plaguing a specific state and the like. We move on to discussing the analysis and also how this can be improved through the availability of more comprehensive data, perhaps something that financial institutions themselves record.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n@abhaar @avinsrid @nachirau @ss91\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nOne of the biggest challenges for banks is minimizing customer attrition rate which is directly dependent on customer satisfaction. Customers are inclined to choose the banks who can be trusted for their services. Banks make their decisions based on a subset of data because of absence of scalable solutions. In this project, we propose a scalable design to counter the above problems!\r\n\r\n## Our Work\r\n* Classification\r\n* Performance Metric Analyses\r\n* Data Analysis using Hive\r\n\r\n## What have we achieved?\r\n* Used machine learning libraries such as Apache Mahout to perform classifications on raw data sets for banks and states to ensure they have better understanding of customer sentiments.\r\n* Performed data analysis on the data sets using Hive, to give a detailed overview of the banks’ performance from a customer sentiment perspective.\r\n* Developed a novel metric system that assigns priorities to customers’ complaints. This helps banks prioritize customers’ problems on specific constraints such as response time, etc. With our new metric system, banks can relatively prioritize the complaints to resolve!\r\n\r\n## DEMO of our Work\r\n\r\n## Compilation Instructions\r\n+ **Classification**\r\n\r\n`$ git clone https://github.com/Sapphirine/Customer-Complaint-Analyses.git`  \r\n`$ cd Customer-Complaint-Analyses/PROJECT_CODE/`  \r\n`$ mvn clean install`  \r\n`$ hadoop jar target/Classification-Files-Big-Data-Project-1.0.jar com.bigdata.complaintanalysis.ClassificationAutomator data/Consumer_Complaints.csv`  \r\n\r\n*Note: Ensure Hadoop 2.5.1, Maven are installed.
